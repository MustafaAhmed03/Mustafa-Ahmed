From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated with how technology interacts with our world. I’ve always loved asking questions and I’m obsessed with acquiring new knowledge. 

This love for learning smoothly transitioned into a love for programming. I remember completing a basic recursion assignment in my introduction to computer science class, and after testing my code for hours, seeing the full green bar indicating that I passed all test cases filled me with so much joy. And that was just for an assignment! I couldn’t imagine how exciting it would be to complete bigger and more complex projects in the future, so I decided to keep going down this path and see what I can find!

I’m currently an aspiring product manager looking for full time opportunities; hoping to translate curiosity into algorithms, programs, and projects that help people around the world!
